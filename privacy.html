    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 14/12/2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Dean_ITC</strong> ("the App") handles your data. We believe in complete transparency. Because this App is designed as a tool for paranormal research and experimentation, we want to be explicitly clear about what the App does and does not do.</p>

    <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</strong></p>
    <p>The App functions entirely offline. We do not require you to create an account, log in, or provide your name, email address, or phone number.</p>

    <h2>2. Hardware Permissions & Usage</h2>
    <p>The App requires minimal permissions to function. Below is an explanation of how specific hardware features are used:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> <span class="highlight">OPTIONAL.</span> You can choose to use microphone input or keyboard. You need to provide your 'Question' somehow when using 'question' mode with AI interpretation.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> <span class="highlight">NOT USED.</span> This App does not access your camera.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Internet Access:</strong> <span class="highlight">OPTIONAL.</span> If you choose to subscibe and use the AI interpreter then the App will connect to the internet in order to access the AI API. 
            No data is sent to external servers, cloud storage, or third-party analytics services. Only your question and the 'sprit' response is sent.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Storage (Photos/Media/Files):</strong> The App uses storage access solely for the purpose of saving <strong>Session Logs</strong> to your device's "Downloads" folder at your explicit request. These files are stored locally on your device. We (the developers) have no access to these files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How the "Entropy Engine" Works</h2>
    <p>To generate output, the App monitors microscopic fluctuations in your device's CPU timing (hardware jitter). This process involves reading internal system clock timing in nanoseconds.</p>
    <p>This data is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Processed locally in real-time (RAM).</li>
        <li>Used immediately to select words from the internal dictionary.</li>
        <li><strong>Discarded immediately</strong> after use.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This technical data acts as a random seed generator and is never stored or associated with your identity.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not contain third-party advertisements, tracking pixels, or analytics SDKs (such as Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel). Your usage data remains private to your device.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children. As the App operates offline and collects no data, it is safe for use, though intended for mature audiences due to the abstract nature of the content.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at:</p>

        var element = document.getElementById('contact-link');
        var link = document.createElement('a');
        link.href = 'mailto:' + user + '@' + domain;
