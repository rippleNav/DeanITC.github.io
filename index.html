                <h3>01. The Accumulation</h3>
                <p>Dean_ITC monitors microscopic electrical fluctuations in your processor. An external influence must exert sustained energy to "heat" a specific memory address until it boils over into a word.</p>

                <h3>02. The Dictionary</h3>
                <p>Built on the 1961 Brown Corpus. The output is distinct, poetic, and often abstract. Do not expect modern slang. Expect "Dream Logic" and high strangeness.</p>

                <h3>03. Zero Bias</h3>
                <p>No Artificial Intelligence. No pre-recorded audio banks. No microphone access. It is a closed loop system powered entirely by hardware entropy.</p>

    <!-- EXPLANATION -->
    <section class="container">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Most ghost boxes use random number generators. Dean_ITC uses <strong>Resistance</strong>.</p>
        <p>Think of it as a Leaky Bucket. The system is constantly draining energy (Cooling). To speak, the input source must generate hits faster than the system drains them. Random noise fades to silence. Only deliberate, sustained intent breaks through.</p>
        <p>If the screen is black, it means the line is silent. We value silence over fake noise.</p>

        In case you are new to this, Entities/spirits do not respond with yes/no or give you lottery numbers. Things are different on the other side and they 'think' in concepts rather than words. 
        They are also not 'allowed' to tell you many things due to the 'law of continuity' etc so they speak in metaphors and riddles, hoping you will figure the truth out for yourself.
        Their response will seem poetic and you will need to read it slowly and carefully to figure out what they are trying to tell you.eg, a response mentioning Rwanda might not refer to the actual country but might refer to civil war instead, given that places history.A response about a 'curtain'  might refer to the 'iron curtain' eg old Russia, USSR etc
